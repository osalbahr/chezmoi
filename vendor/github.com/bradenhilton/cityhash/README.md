# CityHash

#### Version 1, for Go

This is essentially a fork of https://github.com/zentures/cityhash (previously https://github.com/zhenjl/cityhash), with changes to match the behaviour of version 1 of CityHash.

For reference, version 1 of CityHash is available [here](https://github.com/google/cityhash/tree/6efae233528bbec2f057d2d1aa78f10d13fa73ea/src).

Pull Requests for fixes and optimisations (if applicable) are welcome.

The tests are based on my own manual tests of the C++ version.
